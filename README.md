# PR Webhook Automation

Automate PR workflows with Claude Code using a plan-driven development approach.

## Workflow

1. **Planning** — Make a detailed plan, a markdown file in `docs/plans/` folder that can be generated by `/superpowers:brainstorming` in claude code interactively.
2. **Plan** — Run `/superpowers:writing-plans` to generate a detailed implementation plan.
3. **Push & open PR** — Push the plan to a new branch and create a PR (plan file in the repo).
4. **Execute** — Comment `[action]` on the PR; Claude executes the plan (subagent-driven) and pushes commits.
5. **Review** — Review the changes; comment `[fix]` to have Claude address review comments.
6. **Repeat** — Repeat steps 4–5 until ready to merge.

## Features

- **Event-driven**: GitHub webhooks trigger jobs instantly (no polling)
- **Reliable**: SQLite job queue with deduplication and failure handling
- **Secure**: HMAC signature verification, configurable user allowlist
- **Simple**: Single Python server, no external dependencies beyond `cloudflared`

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/user/pr-resolver.git
cd pr-resolver
make setup

# 2. Start services
make services-start

# 3. Verify
make status
```

## PR Commands

Comment on any PR to trigger automation:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `[action]` | Execute the plan file |
| `[fix]` | Address review comments |
| `[status]` | Check queue status |
| `[debug]` | Test the full pipeline |

Plan files are detected in order: `PLAN.md`, `plan.md`, `.claude/plan.md`, `docs/plan.md`, or any file in `docs/plans/*.md`.

## Architecture

```
GitHub PR Comment
       │
       ▼
GitHub Webhook ──► Cloudflare Tunnel ──► Webhook Server ──► Job Queue ──► Claude
                                              │                              │
                                              └────── Status Comments ◄──────┘
```

## Configuration

After `make setup`, edit `.claude/webhook/config.toml`:

```toml
[github]
username = "your-username"      # Only your comments trigger jobs
webhook_secret = "..."          # Generated during setup

[worker]
timeout_minutes = 30            # Max job runtime
max_turns = 100                 # Max Claude API turns

# Option 1: List repos explicitly
[[repos]]
github = "owner/repo"
path = "~/projects/repo"

# Option 2: Watch all repos in a directory
[repos_dir]
path = "~/projects"
max_depth = 2
```

## Make Targets

```bash
make help              # Show all targets

# Setup
make setup             # Full setup wizard
make install-deps      # Install Python dependencies

# Services (launchd)
make services-start    # Start webhook + tunnel
make services-stop     # Stop all services
make services-status   # Check status

# Manual (for testing)
make webhook-start     # Start webhook server
make tunnel-start      # Start tunnel

# Monitoring
make status            # Health check
make logs              # Tail all logs
```

## Adding Webhooks

Use the GitHub CLI to add webhooks:

```bash
WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-tunnel.trycloudflare.com/webhook"
SECRET=$(grep webhook_secret .claude/webhook/config.toml | cut -d'"' -f2)

gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/hooks --method POST --input - <<EOF
{"config":{"url":"$WEBHOOK_URL","content_type":"json","secret":"$SECRET"},"events":["issue_comment"],"active":true}
EOF
```

Or add webhooks for all repos in a directory:

```bash
for dir in ~/projects/*/; do
  repo=$(cd "$dir" && git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed -E 's|.*github.com[:/]||;s|\.git$||')
  [ -n "$repo" ] && gh api "repos/$repo/hooks" --method POST --input - <<EOF
{"config":{"url":"$WEBHOOK_URL","content_type":"json","secret":"$SECRET"},"events":["issue_comment"],"active":true}
EOF
done
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`)
- [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/) (`cloudflared`)

## GitHub Actions (Recommended)

Use GitHub Actions for simpler setup - no webhook server or tunnel needed.

### First-Time Setup

#### Step 1: Add workflow to your repo

```bash
# Copy the workflow file
mkdir -p your-repo/.github/workflows
cp pr-resolver/.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml your-repo/.github/workflows/

# Commit and push
cd your-repo
git add .github/workflows && git commit -m "Add PR automation workflow" && git push
```

#### Step 2: Setup a self-hosted runner

Each repo needs its own runner. Use the provided setup script:

```bash
# Configure (edit runner-config.toml to add your repos)
cd pr-resolver/.claude
vi runner-config.toml

# Setup runner for a single repo
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
./setup-runner.sh owner/repo

# Or setup all repos in config
make setup-all ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

**Get your Anthropic API key:** https://console.anthropic.com/

**Get runner registration token:**
1. Go to your repo → Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner
2. Copy the token from the configuration command

#### Step 3: Test the setup

```bash
# Check runner status
cd pr-resolver/.claude
make status

# Create a test PR with a plan file, then comment:
# [debug]   - Test the pipeline
# [action]  - Execute the plan
```

### Runner Management

All runners are stored in `~/actions-runners/`:

```bash
cd pr-resolver/.claude

make status                  # Show all runner status
make start                   # Start all runners
make stop                    # Stop all runners
make restart                 # Restart all runners
make setup REPO=owner/repo   # Add new runner
make remove REPO=owner/repo  # Remove a runner
make list                    # List configured repos
```

### Configuration File

Edit `.claude/runner-config.toml`:

```toml
[runner]
base_dir = "~/actions-runners"
runner_version = "2.321.0"

[[repos]]
repo = "owner/repo1"

[[repos]]
repo = "owner/repo2"
```

### Alternative: GitHub-hosted Runner

If you prefer not to run a local runner:

1. Edit workflow: change `runs-on: self-hosted` to `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
2. Add secret: Settings → Secrets → Actions → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**Trade-offs:**
- ✓ No local machine needed
- ✗ Slower (installs Claude CLI each run)
- ✗ Uses GitHub Actions minutes
- ✗ Requires API key in GitHub secrets

### Status Checks

The workflow reports status directly on the PR (pending → success/failure), visible in the PR's checks section.

## Troubleshooting

### Cloudflare Login Zone Selection

When `cloudflared tunnel login` asks you to select a zone, pick **any zone** you have access to. This is just for authentication.

### PATH Issues in launchd

If `gh` or `claude` commands fail, ensure `/opt/homebrew/bin` (or your install path) is in the PATH environment variable in the launchd plist.

### Quick Tunnel Mode (Alternative)

If you cannot use named tunnels (e.g., Cloudflare Universal SSL unavailable in your region), use Quick Tunnel mode:

```bash
.claude/scripts/start-tunnel.sh
```

This script:
1. Starts a Quick Tunnel (URL changes on restart)
2. Automatically updates all GitHub webhook URLs
3. Prints the new tunnel URL

Run this script each time you restart the tunnel.
